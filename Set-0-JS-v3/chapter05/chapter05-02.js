// 2. Implement the following:
//      a. A large building has many people and pieces of equipment. A new tech-support
//          employee has been hired to help out solve usersâ€™ problems and fix broken equipment. 
//          The new employee is still unfamiliar with the layout but is doing his best to keep 
//          track of where everyone and everything is.
//          i. Implement a structure that represents the building.
//                  1. Must contain data types representing equipment and users.
//          ii. Equipment can be associated with rooms or specific people
//          iii. Each piece of equipment and person is associated with a specific floor and room.
//          iv. The new tech-support employee must be able to find users and
//              equipment as quickly as possible.
//          v. The new employee must remember past searches

//  Use of memoization and implementation of a simple searching algorithm.


var building = (function () { 
   let equipment_users = {};   // I utilize an object to store the items as a property-value pair 
   var searches = new Map();

   return {  
      addItem: function (item, floor) {
         const keyword = `${item}`; // This is the keyword of the item.
           try {  
               if(arguments.length>2) throw "E1";      // This error code means to many arguments
               if(arguments.length<2) throw "E2";      // This error code means to few arguments 
               if (equipment_users.hasOwnProperty(keyword)) throw "E3";   // This error code means Item Information Previously Stored 
               equipment_users[keyword] = floor;          // Store the new property an value
               return equipment_users[keyword];
           }catch(err) {
               return err;

               if(arguments.length<1) throw "E2";      // This error code means to few arguments
               if (searches.has(item)){
                  console.log('Item previously searched')
                  return searches.get(item);           // Information obtained from hashmap
               }else{
                  if (!equipment_users.hasOwnProperty(keyword)) throw "E4";  // This error code means Item do not exist
                  searches.set(keyword, equipment_users[keyword]);  // Feeding the hashmap
                  return equipment_users[keyword]; 
               }
